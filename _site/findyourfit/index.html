        <!--RESULTS-->

      <div class="results">
        <div class="question result rElectric">
            <h3>You've been paired with the electric guitar!</h3>
            <p>The elecrtric guitar is friendly to both beginners and veterans alike. They can also be found at almost any price point. They're also one of the most iconic instruments in music today, making them the most versatile choice for any player. Fender and Epiphone make excellent guitars at most price points. A Gibson would be the best option when looking for a higher end model. If you want to learn more, check out the <a href="/references/electric.html">references</a> page for the electric guitar. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="question result rAcoustic">
            <h3>You've been paired with the Acoustic guitar!</h3>
            <p>The acoustic guitar is great for beginners and veterans alike, and is probably the easiest guitar to find at any price point. They are the easiest guitar to pick up for a beginner. Epiphone and Fender make great acoustic guitars at relatively low price points, while Martin and Taylor makes are higher end models. If you want to learn more, check out the <a href="/references/acoustic.html">references</a> page for the acoustic guitar.
        </div>
        <div class="question result rHollowbody">
            <h3>You've been paired with the Hollowbody guitar!</h3>
            <p>Hollowbody guitars are a gret mix between the best of the acoustic realm and the electric. they're usually used for their "twang" factor, which makes them a great choice for country music. Additionally, they're great for soft rock and relaxed playing. However, they can get mean when you need them to, but they are not made for the hard rock distortion sounds that traditional electrics offer. The main downfall to these style guitars is they're usually higher in price. Gretsch and Gibson make excellent hollowbody guitars. If you want to learn more, check out the <a href="/references/hollowbody.html">references</a> page for the hollowbody guitar.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="question result rClassical">
            <h3>You've been paired with the Classical guitar!</h3>
            <p>Classical guitars are great for easy going players, and beginners alike. Classical guitars use nylon strings, which makes them easier on the hands especially when learning to play. They are also used in flamenco style music, which is a very advanced style of play. This makes them very versatile for most players. However, I would recommend you go to the store and pick up a classical before you make any purchase decision, they are definitely one of the more unique guitars of the bunch. They can usually be found between $300 - $1000. If you want to learn more, check out the <a href="/references/classical.html">references</a> page for the classical guitar. </p>
