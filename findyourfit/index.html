            <h3>You've been paired with the Acoustic guitar!</h3>
            <p>The acoustic guitar is great for beginners and veterans alike, and is probably the best guitar to find at any price point. They are also the easiest and most popular guitar to pick up for a beginner.

        <div class="question rHollowbody">
            <h3>You've been paired with the Hollowbody guitar!</h3>
            <p>Hollowbody guitars are a great mix between the best of the acoustic realm and the electric. they're usually used for their "twang" factor, which makes them a great choice for country music. Additionally, they're great for soft rock and relaxed playing. However, they can get mean when you need them to, but they are not made for the hard rock distortion sounds that traditional electrics offer. The main downfall to these style guitars is they're usually higher in price. Gretsch and Gibson make excellent hollowbody guitars.

        <div class="question rClassical">
            <h3>You've been paired with the Classical guitar!</h3>
            <p>Classical guitars are great for hardcore players and beginners alike. Classical guitars use nylon strings, which makes them easier on the hands especially when learning to play. They are also used in flamenco style music, which is a very advanced style of play. This makes them very versatile for most players. However, I would recommend you go to the store and pick up a classical before you make any purchase decision, they are definitely one of the more unique guitars in the bunch and aren't worth a blind buy. They can usually be found between $300 - $1000. If you want to learn more, check out the <a href="{{ "/references/classical.html" | relative_url }}">references</a> page for the classical guitar.
