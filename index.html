        <p>So why even learn Guitar? It was certainly something I never really considered growing up. I wasn't the guy who was naturally inclined to explore tons of different hobbies. I certainly wasnt inclined either to explore lots of hobbies. I started to impress a girl in my high school band class who was captivated upon seeing one of my fellow trumpet players pick up a guitar and play a beautiful tune. Back then, being the shy, secluded kid that I was, I thought this was my shot.</p>
        
        <p> Five years later I still play, but for different reasons. Over this time I have been blessed with such a rewarding experience from playing guitar, and I would recommend anyone to pick one up and give it a go. The purpose of this blog is to help you find whats right for you. Starting out it can be frustrating, intimidating, and expensive. Feel free to take our <a href="/">Questionaire</a>, and I can match you with what I feel would be the best guitar style for you.
