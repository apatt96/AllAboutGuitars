        <p>So why even learn Guitar? It was certainly something I never really considered growing up. I wasn't the guy who was naturally inclined to explore tons of different hobbies. I started to impress a girl in my high school band class who was captivated upon seeing one of my fellow trumpet players pick up a guitar and play a beautiful tune. Back then, being the shy, secluded kid that I was, I thought this was my shot.</p>

        <p> Five years later I still play, but for different reasons. Over this time I have been blessed with such a rewarding experience from playing guitar, and I would recommend anyone to pick one up and give it a go. The purpose of this blog is to help you find what's right for you, especially if you're new. Starting out can be frustrating, intimidating, and expensive. Feel free to take our <a href="{{ "/findyourfit/index.html" | relative_url }}">"Find Your Fit"</a> questionaire, and I can match you with what I feel would be the best guitar style for you to pick up. Or, if you're feeling extra interested and studious, check out <a href="{{ "/types/index.html" | relative_url }}">our page for the types</a> of guitars available where the most popular styles of guitars are explained in further detail.
