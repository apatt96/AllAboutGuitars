        <p>So why even learn Guitar? It was certainly something I never really considered growing up. I wasn't the guy who was naturally inclined to explore tons of different hobbies. I started so I could impress a girl in my high school band class who was captivated upon seeing one of my fellow trumpet players pick up a guitar and play a beautiful tune. Back then, being the shy, secluded kid that I was, I thought this was my shot.</p>

        <p> Five years later I still play, but for different reasons. Over this time I have been blessed with such a rewarding experience from playing guitar, and I would recommend anyone to pick one up and give it a go. The purpose of this blog is to help you find what's right for you, especially if you're new to the guitar. Starting out can be frustrating, intimidating, and expensive. I recommend taking the <a href="{{ "/findyourfit/index.html" | relative_url }}">"Find Your Fit"</a> questionaire, and I can match you with what I feel would be the best guitar style for you. If you're feeling extra studious, check out <a href="{{ "/types/index.html" | relative_url }}">the types page</a> which details a variety of the most popular guitars available.
